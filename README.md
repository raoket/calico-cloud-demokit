# Calico Cloud Demo Workshop 🚀  

Welcome to the **Calico Cloud Demo Workshop** — your hands-on guide to experiencing **enterprise-grade Kubernetes security and observability**.  

With this workshop, you’ll learn how Calico Cloud helps teams:  
- Enforce **Zero Trust microsegmentation** with fine-grained policies  
- Block **known malicious traffic** using threat intelligence feeds  
- Gain **real-time visibility** into workloads, flows, and dependencies  
- Simplify **compliance at scale** with policy tiers and audit-ready guardrails  
- Empower DevOps and Security teams to **ship faster, safer, and with confidence**  

---

## 🛠️ What You’ll Build  

By the end of this workshop, you will:  
- Connect your Kubernetes cluster to **Calico Cloud**  
- Deploy three demo applications:  
  - **Online Boutique** 🛍️ — modern e-commerce microservices app  
  - **YaoBank** 🏦 — classic 3-tier banking system  
  - **Bookinfo** 📚 — product page with supporting services  
- Expose them via the **NGINX Ingress Controller**  
- Secure traffic flows using **Calico tiers and network policies** (security → platform → application → appsec)  

This journey shows both **business value** (compliance, Zero Trust, visibility) and **technical depth** (eBPF data plane, policy hierarchy, observability).
